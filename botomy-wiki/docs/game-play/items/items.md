## Big Potions

Big potions (maybe there will be little potions in the future?) heal you to 100% of your max health.

There is a limit to how many you can carry at the same time

## Feathers

Feathers give your character a movement speed boost. These stack - i.e. you can use multiple at a time to increase the speed boost factor and duration.

:::info
The speed boost factor is limited by level but the duration is not. i.e. if you use 10 feathers, your boost may only be equivalent to 3 boosts but the duration will be 10

## Coins

Coins are pretty. They give you more points.

Typically, different colored coins indicate different values. In descending order: gold, blue, red.
