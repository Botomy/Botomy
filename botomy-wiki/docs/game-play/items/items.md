## Feathers

## Coins

Coins are pretty. They give you more points.

Typically, different colored coins indicate different values. In descending order: gold, blue, red.

## Speed Zappers

`{"use": "speed_zapper"}`
Speed Zappers will slow down anyone caught in it's blast. The affect stacks (additive) but the duration is fixed based on first impact.

`radius = 950`

## Rings

`{"use": "ring"}`
Rings give you the ability to cloak. While you are cloaked, you will be invisible to enemies and players.

Shields don't work while you are cloaked. If you have a shield up and you cloak, the shield will be taken down.

Attacking while cloaking will temporarily make you uncloaked.

Using multiple rings will increase the cloak duration.
