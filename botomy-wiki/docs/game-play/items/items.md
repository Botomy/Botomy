# Items

## Big Potions

`{"use": "big_potion"}`
Big potions (maybe there will be little potions in the future?) heal you to 100% of your max health.

## Coins

Coins are pretty. They give you more points.

Typically, different colored coins indicate different values. In descending order: gold, blue, red.

## Speed Zappers

`{"use": "speed_zapper"}`
Speed Zappers will slow down anyone caught in it's blast. This does not stack (i.e. getting zapped while you're zapped doesn't have any addition affect)

`radius = 950`

## Rings

`{"use": "ring"}`
Rings give you the ability to cloak. While you are cloaked, you will be invisible to enemies and players.

Shields don't work while you are cloaked. If you have a shield up and you cloak, the shield will be taken down.

Attacking while cloaking will temporarily make you uncloaked.

Using multiple rings will increase the cloak duration.
