# Levelling

As you play, you'll gain experience points (XP) and level up. Here's how the levelling system works:

## Level Progression

- Start at level 1
- Maximum level is 30
- Earn XP by:
  - Eliminating enemies
  - Collecting coins and other items

## Skill Points

- Earn one skill point per level up to level 20
- Redeem skill points to improve:
  - Attack (max 10 points, +7 damage per point)
  - Speed (max 5 points, +25 speed per point)
  - Health (max 8 points, +30 health per point)

:::tip
Use `redeem_skill_point` with "attack", "speed", or "health" to improve your character
:::

:::info

- Choose your skill point allocation carefully - you can't reset them during a match
- With 20 total skill points available, you cannot max out all categories (which would require 23 points)
  :::

## Maximum Stats

At max level with all skill points spent:

- Attack: +70 damage (10 points)
- Speed: +125 speed (5 points)
- Health: +240 health (8 points)
