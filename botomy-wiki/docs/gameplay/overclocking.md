# Overclocking

Overclocking provides powerful bonuses based on your kill streak. There are 4 levels of overclocking, each unlocking at different streak thresholds.

## Overclock Levels

### Speed Boost

- Unlocks at 20 kill streak
- Increases movement speed by 30% (1.3x multiplier)

### Damage Boost

- Unlocks at 50 kill streak
- Increases attack damage by 20% (1.2x multiplier)

### Health Regeneration

- Unlocks at 80 kill streak
- Regenerates 10 health per second

### Super Mode

- Unlocks at 125 kill streak
- Sets attack damage to 9001 (It's over 9000!)

## How It Works

- Overclocking lasts for 15 seconds once activated
- Each kill resets the 15 second timer
- Can potentially last indefinitely with continuous kills
- Ends if you die or time runs out
- Kill streak resets when overclocking ends

:::tip
Keep your kill streak going to maintain overclocking benefits!
