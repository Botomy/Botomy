Coins are pretty. They give you more points.

## Speed Zappers

`{"use": "speed_zapper"}`
Speed Zappers will slow down anyone caught in it's blast. This does not stack (i.e. getting zapped while you're zapped doesn't have any addition affect)

`radius = 950`

## Rings

![Ring](./img/ring.png)

`{"use": "ring"}`
Rings give you the ability to cloak. While you are cloaked, you will be invisible to enemies and players.

Shields don't work while you are cloaked. If you have a shield up and you cloak, the shield will be taken down.

Attacking while cloaking will temporarily make you uncloaked.

Using multiple rings will increase the cloak duration.
