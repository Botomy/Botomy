0.22.0 Release - Cloaking

<!-- truncate -->

This release introduces a new power up - the ring!

This ring allows a play to cloak. Once cloaked, a player is not visible to other players or enemies.

Attacking will decloak.

Shields cannot be raised when cloaked. Cloaking will take down your shield.
