Getting ready for launch!
Steam integrations, document updates, and onboarding

<!-- truncate -->

It's been awhile since the last blog update and much has changed. I've removed scripting mode, tweaked many gameplay mechanics, and launched a Steam page.

I'll write a longer post later but here are some major features for launch:

- API mode (script mode is gone) - players must set up a local development environemnt to run an endpoint for the game to call. Starter projects are provided in typescript and python
- Free for All and Survival game modes (RPG has been renamed to FFA)
- Tutorial - walk through the basics
- Steam Lobbies - rather than roll my own, I've switched over to Steam. You can now invite friends to play through Steam
- Steam Achievements - Adding a bunch of achievements via Steam
- Global servers - spun up Seoul, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo, N. California, and Ohio based on wishlists on Steam

Working on next:

- more documentation and maybe some videos to help

## Breaking changes

- 0.41.0 -> 0.74.0 a lot
- 0.74.0 -> 0.75.0 `own_player.items[item_type]` is now a inventory count rather than a list of objects
